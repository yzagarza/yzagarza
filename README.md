### About Me
After spending a decade fostering my marketing career, I decided to change paths to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer. I'm excited to share my journey by posting projects on here as I develop my technical skills. I welcome any and all feedback, as long as they are constructive in nature. When dealing with change, I believe a community goes a long way. So, if anybody wants to connect, provide advice or offer words of support, please feel free to reach out! I'm also open for professional opportunities. 

### What do I do for Fun?
- House renovation projects
- Furniture upcycling
- Attempt to recreate my favorite restaurant dishes at home
- Hiking or walking along trails
- Weight lifting
- Traveling (goal is to visit all 7 continents and I've currently been stuck on #4 due to the pandemic)
